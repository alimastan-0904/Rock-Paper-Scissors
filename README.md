# Rock-Paper-Scissors

[Live Preview](https://alimastan-0904.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors/)

## Description

This project was created as part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com) JavaScript Foundation course.
It will test my ability to utilise beginner level HTML, CSS and JavaScript (both scripting and DOM Manipulation) to create a functioning game where you play Rock Paper Scissors against a computer.
